OVERVIEW

dap is a program to "Display Atoms" with "Python", based on ASE 
    https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/
and vtk
    https://pypi.org/project/vtk/

FUNCTIONALITY
    - display atoms from any ase.io.read compatible format
        atom color/radius by fixed value or based on arbitrary scalar Atoms.arrays property
        atomic labels from ID# or other property (e.g. Z, species, or arbitrary Atoms.arrays property)
    - create bonds by cutoff or indices (optionally filtered by type)
        bonds across PBCs displayed as two half bonds
    - display isosurfaces from volumetric data over the config unit cell (including non-orthorhombic)
        a simple native ASCII format
        CHGCAR using VaspChargeDensity from ase.calculators.vasp 
        WAVECAR using Wavecar from pymatgen.io.vasp.outputs (patched to read gamma-point only runs)
    - display vectors associated with each atom (like magnetic moments), either from real 3-vector field, or from scalar field
    - display coordination polyhedra given atom type of center and bonds or cutoff to neighbors
    - multiple configurations interpreted as trajectories (i.e. identical camera view)
    - frame label from arbitrary Atoms.info field
    - snapshots by rendering at arbitrary integer multiples of display resolution
    - automated movie creation (requires ffmpeg executable in path)
    - arbitrary ASE functions applied to atomic configurations
    - display legend with each used atom type
    - save full state of display (settings, atoms, bonds, etc., as well as view orientation, but not window size)
    - command history using GNU readline 
    - labels (frame and atom) do python evaluation of expressions in $(EXPR) and substitute
        Atoms.info for ${INFO} and Atoms.arrays for $${ARRAY}

    GUI
        rotate, zoom, translate
        pick by point or area
        measure picked objects (position, distance, angle)
            measurement display is in CLI window

USAGE:
    dap [ -g WIDTHxHEIGHT ] [ -e 'command ... [ ; command ... ] ' ] atoms_filename [ atoms_filename ... ]
Input atoms files can be any ase.io.read compatible format.

Settings commands (which are required to define atomic/bond types before the atoms files are read in) 
are read from
    ~/.daprc
and then
    $PWD/.daprc

Additional commands can be passed with '-e', and these include 'read commands_filename' to read 
commands from a file.

GUI help is available by typing 'h' in the GUI window (but displayed in the CLI window).
CLI help is available with 'usage' or, for each command, with 'command -h' in the CLI winow

TODO (in expected order of implementation)
    MAYBE DONE?
        get rid of bond_type and surface_type, replace with direct color/material/radius arguments to bond, volume, and polyhedra commands
        read WAVECAR (medium - graphics easy, but need to read binary and do FFT)

    STARTED
        optimize rebuilding of scene to minimize cost, e.g. if only color changes are possible, don't recreate full objects unnecessarily (medium) [STARTED]

    NOT EVEN STARTED

        color isosurfaces by a scalar (medium)
        measure angle for atoms, not just bonds ? (easy)
        display measurements in GUI ? (medium)
        better examples (easy)
        slices through volumetric data (maybe also voxel visualization) (depends on vtk support)
        better integration with ASE data structures (varies)
        read CHG as well as CHGCAR (easy)
