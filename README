OVERVIEW

dap is a program to "Display Atoms" with "Python", based on ASE 
    https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/
and vtk
    https://pypi.org/project/vtk/

FUNCTIONALITY
    display atoms from any ase.io.read compatible format
        atom color/radius by fixed value or based on arbitrary scalar Atoms.arrays property
        atomic labels from ID# or other proprty (e.g. Z, species, or arbitrary Atoms.arrays property)
    create bonds by cutoff or indices (optionally filtered by type)
        bonds across PBCs show up as two half bonds
    display isosurfaces from volumetric data over the config unit cell (including non-orthorhombic)
        simple ASCII format
        CHGCAR from VaspChargeDensity from ase.calculators.vasp 
    multiple configurations interpreted as trajectories (i.e. identical camera view)
    snapshots by rendering at arbitrary integer multiples of display resolution
    automated movie creation (requires ffmpeg executable)
    arbitrary ASE commands applied to atomic configurations
    display legend with each used atom type
    save full state of display (settings, atoms, bonds, volumetric data, but not including window size)
    command history using readline 

    GUI
        rotate, zoom, translate
        pick by point or area
        measure picked objects (position, distance, angle)
            display in CLI window

USAGE:
    dap [ -g WIDTHxHEIGHT ] [ -e 'command ... [ ; command ... ] ' ] atoms_filename [ atoms_filename ... ]
Input atoms files can be any ase.io.read compatible format.

Settings commands (which are required to define atomic/bond types before the atoms files are read in) 
are read from
    ~/.daprc
and then
    $PWD/.daprc

Additional commands can be passed with '-e', and these include 'read commands_filename' to read 
commands from a file.

GUI help is available by typing 'h' in the GUI window (but displayed in the CLI window).
CLI help is available with 'usage' or for each command with 'command -h' in the CLI winow

TODO (in no particular order, difficulty in parens)
    read CHG as well as CHGCAR (easy)
    better integration with ASE data structures (hard)
    measure angle for atoms, not just bonds ? (easy)
    display measurements in GUI ? (medium)
    fix right vs. left-handed coord system (medium)
    slices through volumetric data (maybe also voxel visualization) (depends on vtk support)
    color isosurfaces by a scalar (medium)
    better examples (easy)
    atoms and bonds through native vtkGlyph3D (medium-hard, but much faster, probably worth it) [ BONDS DONE ]
    optimize rebuilding of scene to minimize cost, e.g. if only color changes are possible, don't recreate full objects unnecessarily (medium) [STARTED]
