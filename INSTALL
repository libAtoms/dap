dap - Display Atoms with Python

Make sure the python3 and pip3 executables you want are in your path.

On a Mac with python 3.8, first run
    pip3 install --user vtk-9.0.0-cp38-cp38-macosx_10_14_x86_64.whl

To install, copy wheel file to your own directory, then do
    pip3 install --user dap-VERSION-py3-none-any.whl

The installation process should also install prerequisites (ASE and vtk)
using pip if needed.  Note that pymatgen is required for WAVECAR plotting,
but that is _not_ automatically installed as a dependency - you'll need
to pip install it manually.
